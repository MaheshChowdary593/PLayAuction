DIRECTIONS FOR EVALUATION:
1. **Be Brutal**: If a selection is a waste of money (old, poor stats, or overpriced), call it out. If the squad is balanced but lacks a "X-factor" superstar, mark them down.
2. **Tactical Depth**: Check for "finishers", "death bowlers", and "Powerplay specialists". Don't just look at names, look at the stats.
3. **Budget Usage**: Leaving too much money on the table is a fireable offense. Spending it all on one or two players is equally stupid.
4. **Grant Granularity**: Use the overallScore to distinguish quality.
